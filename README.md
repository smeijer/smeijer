### Hi, I'm Stephan 👋

I work on a closed-source business-to-business collaboration platform, and create and maintain open source projects in my spare time. 

Projects that I'm currently working on are:

name | description
--- | ---
[leaflet-geosearch] | (Leaflet) GeoSearch / GeoCode provider
[unimported] | Find unused source files in javascript / typescript projects.
[where-broke] | Find the version of a lib that broke your tests
[testing-playground] | 🐸 Simple and complete DOM testing playground that encourage good testing practices.
[issupported] | Check if your (users) browser is still supported by your (favorite) websites.
[updrafts.app] | A Tailwind Studio that empowers you to build professional, custom designs, in a completely visual canvas.
