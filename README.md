### Hi, I'm Stephan ðŸ‘‹

I work on a closed-source business-to-business collaboration platform, and create and maintain open source projects in my spare time. 

I haven't always been ~~a developer~~ coding for a living though. I've graduated in "engineering & architecture" and started my career working for an architect as cad-operator. I later switched jobs, and started to work for an engineering firm focussed on underground infrastructures and railways. That was when I first got to experience the imposter syndrome. I felt that my education didn't match my profession, so I got myself a bachelor in "geomatics".

In my early career, I was automating my own work away all-the-time. It took me a while to realize that I should stop with whatever I was doing, and switch my profession one more time. I couldn't keep this as a hobby, I should start making a living out of it. And so I did.

That's me, Stephan. Father of two boys, and husband of my wife Katya.
